A TODO list :-)

- Gapless playback

- Add various options to config.cfg
- ReplayGain
- last.fm
- Select multiple rows in playlist with the mouse
- Test (& fix) various browsers
- Actually deal with various errors that may occur
- More flexible library view (ie. grouping by arbitrary tags)
- Specify columns in playlist
- Resize columns in playlist
- Support for reading more codecs (ape, mpc, aac, etc.)
