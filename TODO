A TODO list :-)

- Save/edit/remove of searches

- We could deal with various artists albums better (ie. show artist for track)
- Switch to aurora.js, or somesuch
- Ability to play local files
- Play FLAC without transcode

- Better indication that something is loading; for example after you've clicked
  on an album to add (this can take a few seconds)
- More flexible library view (ie. grouping by arbitrary tags)
- Ability to tag albums (not ID3 tags, but tags like "heavy metal")
- Ability to specify columns in playlist
- Manually resize columns in playlist
- Seeking sometimes makes the playback pause ... Clicking again solves this

- WebKit/Chrome doesn't buffer properly, can't seek

  We don't *know* the Content-Length, and we can't do content ranges ... :-/
  Even when faking this (With the correct date, as experiment) it doesn't work
  very well, it won't buffer the entire file. Seeking **ONLY** works when using
  Accept-Ranges: bytes, which we can't support...

  Going with aurora.js should hopefull solve this ...?
