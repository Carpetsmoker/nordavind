A TODO list :-)


For 1.0:
- Fix seekbar while buffering
- Caching on the server
- Cache in browser (cache playlist, remove cache when deleting)
- config.ini


For future versions:

- Add various options
- Test various browsers
- Actually deal with various error
- More flexible library (grouping by arbitrary tags)
- Specify columns in playlist
- Resize columns in playlist
- Support for reading more codecs (ape, mpc, aac, etc.)
- Touch device support
- Windows support
