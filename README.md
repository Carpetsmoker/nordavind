Nordavind is a web based audio player. The idea is that you can play your music
collection at home anywhere.

The UI is inspired by foobar2000, or rather, my particular foobar2000 setup (
Nordavind doesn’t offer the *extreme* flexibility that foobar2000 has).


Browser support
===============
Nordavind should work in all current browser versions. Examples of olders
browsers that will *not* work are Internet Explorer 8 and Safari 5.

In particular, I’ve tested Opera 12 and Firefox 23 on Windows & FreeBSD.
I did some basic testing with Chrome 29 and IE10, which seem to work okay.

Note that (most) smartphones & tablets won’t work very well at the moment due to
a number of problems. Some works needs to be done here.


Audio codecs
------------
Nordavid uses the HTML5 `<audio>` capability, while all current browsers support
this quite well, there are some difference, notably, in the supported codecs.

- Firefox and Opera will play Ogg Vorbis files
- Internet Explorer and Safari will play MP3 files
- Chrome will play both

Nordavind will transparently convert files for you, but you should be aware that
converting from MP3 to Ogg Vorbis (or vice versa) *will* reduce audio quality
even at fairly high bitrates because you’re converting from one lossless format
to another. So you may want to choose your browser depending on the format of
you music collection.

Note that converting FLAC to either format is fine.


Installation
============

------------
- A UNIX/Linux machine (Windows will not work)
- [Python 3](http://python.org/) (Python 2 will not work)
- [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)

Configuration

Running
-------
Run `serve.py` to start the server. You can optionally add an `address:port`
to listen on (defaults to `0.0.0.0:8001`).


Security

Adding your music collection
============================
There are two scripts to update your music collection:

- `update.py` Does a full update (add new track, update existing, and remove
  deleted tracks)
- `addnew.py` Only add new tracks; this is significantly faster

Both scripts accept a single argument, which is a directory in your _musicdir_,
if given, only that directory will be updated.

These scripts may give harmless warnings; they're from taglib, You can safely
ignore them (doesn't seem like they can can be disabled...)


Changelog
=========
Version 1.0, TODO
